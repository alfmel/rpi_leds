# LED Experiments for the Raspberry Pi

This project allows you to play with LEDs on the Raspberry Pi. It is
written in Python and requires the installation of the RPi.GPIO library
for Python. In-depth information for this project may be found in my
[Raspberry Pi Blog](https://blogs.mypals.org/pi/). It came about during
my initial tinkering with a Raspberry Pi Zero to learn about the GPIO
pins in Python.

This project is divided into different parts, with each part building on
each other. Each part has its own tag so you may easily view the code
for each part by doing `git checkout partX`.
